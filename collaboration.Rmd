YEAQ are hosting our third event for the year, and it's set to be another good one.

From the biggest and boldest infrastructure projects to the most fundamental technology breakthroughs, effective collaboration is the lifeblood of engineering innovation.

Discover how inspiration developed from one area can be applied to another and how that can shape the industry for years to come.

We're entering an age of going beyond engineering, so let's start the discussion. 

#### Speakers
_Colette Munro - AECOM Chief of Digital_\
_Graeme Newton - CEO Cross River Rail_
 

In addition to hearing from these inspirational speakers, emerging engineers will have the opportunity to sit with and ask questions to the most senior engineers and leaders in our industry over breakfast. Each table will include a minimum of two senior executives.
